## 1.   Introduction

This is a basic Login and Signup Web Template which I created as a part of my Web Development Practice. This is my first project in which I have implemented Front-end in HTML, Bootstrap 4 and JS and data parsing using Custom PHP.   

Right now It includes functionality of Logging in and Signup with basic data validation.

Design is simplistic and clean and Repsonsive and Created by Ankit Passi
