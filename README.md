## 1.   Introduction

This is a basic Login and Signup Web Template which I created as a part of my Web Development Practice. This is my first project in which I have implemented Front-end in HTML, Bootstrap 4 and JS and data parsing using Custom PHP.   

Right now It includes functionality of Logging in and Signup with basic data validation.

Design is simplistic and clean and Repsonsive.

Data is fetched and inserted by Custom PHP API hosted on 000webhost.

1. Enter the data and Login
2. or, Click Signup and Enter data and Click "Register".
